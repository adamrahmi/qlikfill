QlikFill

This is a handmade extension for TSE's inside Qlik.
It will add much needed autofill buttons below the Salesforce comment box, with suggestions.

The suggestions are stored in a seperate file. Future plans for pulling the suggestions from a database instead, with the company VPN.

The main branch will contain the packaged chrome extension.
The dev branch will have the latest changes.
