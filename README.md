QlikFill

This is a handmade extension for TSE's inside Qlik.
It will add much needed autofill buttons below the Salesforce comment box, with suggestions.

The suggestions are stored in a seperate file. Future plans for pulling the suggestions from a database instead, with the company VPN.

The main branch will contain the packaged chrome extension.
The dev branch will have the latest changes.

Usage: Pin the extension button to the top bar. Click on it to add or remove autofill buttons in the textarea in the current tab. The settings page contains all saved and sanitized strings, and the ability to revert them.
